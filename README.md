notification-catcher
====================

A demo app that attempts to detect notification banners.

Requirements:
---

This demo was built against the iOS 7 SDK.

Notes:
---

When you build the demo, you'll see a button. Tapping it will take a screenshot of the app, and install it in your camera roll. It'll also log out a bunch of rects, in an attempt to find the difference between when a notification banner is visible and when no banner is visible. Read the comments to see what's being logged. 

License:

Offically MIT, but do what you want with this code.
